/**
 * Transport layer for Umami collector writes (`POST /api/send`).
 *
 * Umami v3.1.0 has a race in `prisma.sessionData.updateMany()`
 * (umami-software/umami#4183) that returns HTTP 500 for a few percent of
 * requests when a page issues concurrent writes for one session. This module
 * serializes our writes through a single in-flight slot so we stop generating
 * that contention ourselves, and turns the tracker's swallowed failures into an
 * observable delivery signal.
 *
 * Two invariants keep this from becoming a worse failure than the one it fixes:
 *
 *  1. The gate is installed EXACTLY ONCE. It must never re-wrap `window.fetch`
 *     after some other instrumentation (Sentry's breadcrumbs/tracing
 *     integrations, the wm-session interceptor, the desktop runtime patch) has
 *     wrapped it. A second gate delegates through the first, and because both
 *     share this module's queue the inner call blocks on `inFlight` while the
 *     outer awaits it — a permanent deadlock that silently stops all analytics
 *     for the page. Installing once is safe: a later wrapper delegates down to
 *     us, so we still see every collector write.
 *  2. Every dispatch is time-bounded on BOTH sides. The single slot means one
 *     hung request would otherwise wedge every subsequent write for the page's
 *     lifetime. An abort signal alone does not buy that: it bounds the request
 *     only if the transport underneath honors it, and `window.fetch` on this
 *     page is routinely wrapped by third-party instrumentation that does not.
 *     So the slot is released on a deadline this module owns, raced against the
 *     awaited response — see `withCollectorDeadline` and `CollectorFailure.raced`.

   *
   * KNOWN LIMITATION: this is a timing inference, not a fact reported by the

   * impossible — a hidden tab under intensive timer throttling can leave both
   * clocks due in one wake-up, and a cleanly-cancelled write would then be

   *
   * A MARKER rather than a `kind`, for the same reason as `botFiltered`: the

   * timeout it is, so no `kind`-consuming arm has to be re-audited. Unlike
   * `botFiltered`, it is read in two categories of place, and both are

   *
   *  - RE-SEND (the reason the marker exists): `isRetryableCollectorFailure`
   *    and the durable checkout marker in `analytics.ts` both refuse to replay
   *    it, because re-sending an append-only conversion whose original may
   *    still commit double-counts it. `isRetryableIdentityFailure` still
   *    replays — an idempotent overwrite has no such hazard.
   *  - ALERTING: it is exempt from the environment-noise floors, skips the
   *    once-per-cohort noise latch, reports without waiting on the cross-user
   *    aggregate's verdict, and carries its own Sentry fingerprint segment.
   *    Not gold-plating — this fix REMOVES `queue-overflow`, the parked page's
   *    only other symptom, so without these the population goes dark exactly
   *    when the bug is fixed (#6288).
