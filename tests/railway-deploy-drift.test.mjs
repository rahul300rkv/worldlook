// #6141 — the alarm for "a merge never reached production".

// Every fixture below is the shape of a real record pulled from
// `railway deployment list --json` on 2026-08-04. The three that matter:
//
//   SKIPPED  + meta.commitHash   a push Railway refused to build
//   REMOVED  + meta.commitHash   a cron tick, carrying the SHA of the image it ran
//   SUCCESS  + no commitHash     a `railway up` upload, which has no commit at all
//
// The last one is why "newest built deployment" cannot be assumed to identify a
// commit, and the first is why "the service has deployments" cannot be assumed
// to mean it received the merge.
