// Alarms on "production is not running this merge yet", whatever the cause.
//
// Every repository gate can be green while a Railway service keeps running an
// older image: the watch-path filter refuses the push (#6141), the GitHub
// integration stops delivering it (#6064), or the build fails after the merge
// lands. None of those produce a repository signal, and the seeder's own health
// checks cannot see them either — a container on old code publishes
// fresh-looking data.
//
// The #6141 case is a LAG tail rather than a loss: Railway builds the full tree
// at a SHA, so a refused commit rides the next build that fires (p50 0h, p90
// 19h, max 62.6h). That is harmless for a copy tweak and an outage when the
// delayed commit fixes an active crash loop, and nothing inside the repository
// tells the two apart — which is the whole reason to measure the lag.
//
// The check is deliberately independent of why. For every service this
// repository deploys it asks one question: is the source Railway is running the
// commit at the head of main? Anything that is not a positive yes is reported.
