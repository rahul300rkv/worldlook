# Peru National Data Sources Proposal

## Summary

This document proposes a set of Peru-focused national data sources that could expand World Monitor's regional situational awareness coverage for infrastructure, transport, emergency management, hydrometeorology, seismic activity, energy, macroeconomics, and environmental monitoring.

The goal is to identify official or high-value public sources before implementing any new data layer. This proposal is documentation-only and does not introduce code changes, dependencies, or live data ingestion.

## Rationale

Peru is highly exposed to transport disruptions, heavy rains, landslides, floods, earthquakes, energy demand shifts, and regional emergency events. Adding Peru-focused official sources would improve World Monitor's usefulness for:

- LATAM situational awareness.
- Critical infrastructure monitoring.
- Business continuity planning.
- Logistics and transport risk analysis.
- MSP / ISP field operations planning.
- Emergency and disaster monitoring.
- Energy and macroeconomic context.

## Candidate Sources

| Priority | Source | Domain | Potential World Monitor Use |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | MTC / Provias Nacional road status viewer | Transport infrastructure | Road transitability layer |
| 2 | SUTRAN interactive alert map | Road alerts / transport risk | Road disruption and warning layer |
| 3 | INDECI / COEN | Emergency management | Emergency reports and disaster awareness feed |
| 4 | SENAMHI | Weather and hydrometeorology | Rainfall, river, climate and hydrological alert layer |
| 5 | IGP / CENSIS | Seismic monitoring | Peru earthquake layer |
| 6 | COES | Energy grid / electricity | Demand, generation and frequency indicators |
| 7 | BCRPData | Macroeconomics | Peru macro indicators for the finance variant |
| 8 | OEFA / MINAM / SINIA | Environmental monitoring | Water, air, protected areas and environmental risk layers |
| 9 | Peru National Open Data Platform | Public datasets catalog | Source discovery and dataset registry |

## Implementation Notes

Before implementation, each source should be reviewed for:

1. Machine-readable access method: API, RSS, GeoJSON, ArcGIS FeatureServer, WMS/WFS, CSV, JSON or DKAN datastore.
2. License and attribution requirements.
3. Update frequency.
4. Stability of endpoint.
5. Field-level data quality.
6. Geographic coordinates or geocoding feasibility.
7. Whether the data can be safely cached.
8. Whether the source is official, journalistic, civic or third-party.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Validate MTC and SUTRAN map network calls to identify whether they expose a stable public endpoint.
2. Validate INDECI / COEN feeds or report endpoints.
3. Validate SENAMHI alert and hydrological data access.
4. Validate IGP seismic dataset endpoint.
5. See `peru-rss-feed-candidates.md` for Peru RSS feed candidates (added in this PR).
6. Next step: validate endpoint discovery per `peru-road-transitability-layer.md` Phase 1 checklist before introducing live data ingestion.
